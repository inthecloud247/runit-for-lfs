blfs-service-scripts:

This package contains the essential service handling scripts that
are mentioned in the BLFS BOOK. The scripts cannot be installed
independently but need to be installed in conjunction with a
compatible lfs-runit script. See the <lfs-bootscripts.version>
file for compatibility information.

The various install targets are mentioned in the BLFS book. There 
are variables defined for script permissions {MODE}, configuration 
file permissions {CONFMODE}, directory permissions {DIRMODE} and 
destination directory {DESTDIR}.  For more information refer to the 
BLFS BOOK at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/ .
